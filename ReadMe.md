# **MacOS Manjaro**
This is a replica or parody of Apple's MacOS, based on Manjaro with a KDE Desktop Environment and front-end, using LightDM for user / session management, along with ICNS support (MacOS Icon Structure).
#### **Version**: **MacOSM (v0.01)**

### **Credit Required**
If anyone sees icons or content that they've created, just shoot me a message or create a pull request (preferably with some kind of date / link / proof) to add your name where it fits.

<br>

### **Support**
I'll try to support customization plotters like Konsave, Plasma Customizer, or more. If you have a requested addition, or know how to, just make a pull request,
